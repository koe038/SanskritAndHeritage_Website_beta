	<P><I>In this project, we explore how Sanskrit is a scientific language, both in the sense of the structure of the language itself, and how it is capable of conveying scientific ideas, as well as much deeper concepts. We look at several instances of scientific works and texts in Sanskrit throughout history, and at the end, try to address the concept of consciousness, as to how modern science in the form we know today may not be sufficient to unveil its functioning, but our ancient philosophies constructed using the Devabhasha may allow us to better understand the same.</I></P>

    <p>Science and technology have shaped the world in the way we know it today, and continues to do so, allowing us to envision a sophisticated future akin to what we have read or seen in sci-fi books or movies. With the growth of research and advancement of technology, we are slowly stepping into a new era, with Quantum physics as a promising model to grant us answers to the unknown in this exotic cosmos. 
When the idea of Quantum mechanics was first conceived in the early 1900s, it baffled the greatest minds of the time including Planck, who was among the founding fathers of the theory, and Einstein, who put forth his best theories and paradoxes to disprove the same. In fact, together with physicists Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, he put forward the EPR paradox, which questions the concept of quantum entanglement apparently allowing information to travel faster than light, which is forbidden by his theories of relati (Special and General Relativity). But turns out Quantum Mechanics actually does model the physical reality surprisingly well! The dissent over acceptance of QM is actually quite understandable, as before this point, matter had always been thought of as a classical particle for centuries, and this new idea of particles exhibiting wave-like properties such as superposition and attributing to probabilistic observables corresponding to deterministic wavefunctions was somewhat (very much, actually!) disconcerting and spooky. The principle ideas of superposition and wave-particle duality are unique to QM… Or, is it really?</p>
    <p>In fact, you would be surprised to hear if you didn't know already, that these concepts, which are central to the very core of QM, had already been acknowledged long, long back, by one of the most ancient civilizations that ever existed on this planet. A civilization that communicated through the language "Sanskrit". The word Sanskrit or Samskritam is derived from the roots "Samyak" and "Kritam", meaning "well done"… The name is truly justified , from the extremely scientific and sophisticated structure of the language, to the ideas and experiences it is capable of conveying. Sanskrit is a scientific language, and that is precisely what we hope to convey through this writing and also the above video.</p>
	
	<P><H3><B><U><BR><BR><a id="2"></a>A Brief History of Sanskrit</P></H1></B></U>
	<P><BR>Let us dive in as far back into the Primordial days as current historical knowledge allows us to and look at the origins of Sanskrit. As the Indo-European languages bifurcated in Eurasia, Sanskrit originated as one of the emerging stems of Indo-European languages. This language is further classified into two broader groups, firstly, the more ancient Vedic Sanskrit, the vernacular spoken Sanskrit, in which the earliest known works comprises the Rig Veda, as well as the Samaveda, the Yajurveda and the Atharvaveda, and secondly, we have Panini’s Sanskrit, also known as Classical or Laukik Sanskrit.</P>
	<P>Vedic Sanskrit dates as far back as 1500-2000 B.C. when knowledge was passed down through generations orally. Classical Sanskrit arose and flourished roughly between 500 B.C. – 1000 A.D., it’s grammar having been composed by Panini.</P>
	<P>Panini, who is known as the “Father of Linguistics”, arranged the alphabets in the Sanskrit Language in a very logical and scientific manner in his first 14 Sutras of Ashtadhyayi (as early as 4th century B.C.), after close observations of the sources of sounds used in speech. For instance, as you can see in the image below, the vowels have been arranged in line with the shape our mouths take when emitting these sounds.<BR></P>
	<CENTER>
		<img src="images/alphabets.png">
		<P><I>Fig : Sanskrit vowels and Consonants (Left) and their transliterations (Right). Anuswara, visarga, halant, conjuct consonants haven’t been included.</I></P>
	</CENTER>
	<P><BR>In the same way, the sequence of the sequence of the consonants is also scientific. The first line of consonants, also known as the ka-Varga : ka, kha, ga, gha, nga, are pronounced from the throat and hence called ‘Kanthya’. The following lines comprise of the ‘Taalavya’ or palatals (cha-Varga), ‘Murdhanya’ or lingual/retroflex (ta-Varga), ‘Dantya’ or Dentals (ta-Varga), ‘Oshtya’ or labials (pa-Varga), and finally the semi-vowels and sibilants. We can say that no other language in this world has such a rational and systematic system of the alphabet, such a logical order of precedence of the alphabets. Think that if our ancestors had arrange the alphabet so well, how deeply they went in on more advanced matters.</P>
	<P>Again, let us consider the sound “OM”. The sound ‘OM’ (ॐ) is considered as the universal sound, containing three principles: A stands for creation, U for preservation and M for destruction as per the Ekaaskshar Kosh; hence the sound A+U+M.</P>
	<CENTER>
		<img src="images/Om.png">
		<P><I>Fig : OM(ॐ)</I></P>
	</CENTER>
	<P>Imagine saying the sound as plucking a string at the center, and setting off vibrations of equal amplitudes throughout the system. In this case, the system constitutes us, and the vibrations thus set off resonates with our energy and 7 chakras, thus enhancing the brain and overall health. The power of chanting in Sanskrit lies in the fact that all Sanskrit letters connect to the 50 root sounds connected with the aforementioned 7 chakras. Sanskrit shlokas, thus very often, have profound scientific meanings to them and aren’t merely poems or hymns.</P>
	<P>Panini's Sanskrit is the form of Sanskrit we know today, and apart from just the language being scientifically structured, major scientific innovations, as also other works of literature, philosophy, law and the like were done in this language. In this context, we would like to address a general misconception of the present day, with most people associating the language to hymns and sacred, religious texts. In reality, this comprises merely 5% of the works in Sanskrit, and the rest of it constitutes volumes and volumes of works involving math, astronomy, medicine, philosophy etc., much of which tragically could not survive the ravages of time (and invasions). Major philosophical works have been recorded in this language, and philosophy to a great extent is responsible for the growth of science... Let us now start by looking at some of the scientific works in Sanskrit.</P>
	
	<P><H3><B><U><BR><BR><a id="3"></a>Scientific Works in Sanskrit in Ancient Bharat</P></H1></B></U>
	<P><H4><B><I><BR><BR><a id="4"></a>Mathematical Works</P></H1></B></I>
	<P>One of the most important contributions of ancient Bharat to the mathematical community was putting forth the concept of zero as an independent number. Though older civilizations like the Mayans had recorded the use of zero previously, it was only with other numbers that it was meaningful, but it had never been thought to be a standalone number before. Without this idea concept, technology as we know today wouldn't at all have been possible, as the very idea of binary digits/bits would have been alien. 
Further, the decimal number system was a revolutionary theory put forward in those times.</P>
	<P>Now, when we think of Maths and ancient India, the first mathematicians that comes to our mind is Aryabhatta, and rightly so. His mathematical works include linear algebra, geometry, place-value system, trigonometry, indeterminate equations to name a few. He also estimated Pi to be 3.1416, which is an extremely close approximation of 3.14159... Looking at his works in his book, the Aryabhatiya, it is mind-blowing to think of what he came up with. The Aryabhatiya, is divided into 4 sections - Gitikapada with 13 verses which at first describes units, especially larger units of time like Kalpa, Manvantra and Yuga and later on dwells on sine tables; Ganitapada (meaning Mathematics) with 33 verses covering mensuration, finding square and cube roots, arithmetic and geometric progressions, geometry, linear, simultaneous and quadratic equations etc; the Kalakriyapada with 25 verses dealing with positions of planets for a given day, other calculations regarding intercalary months, and naming of weeks; and finally, the Golapada, with 50 verse mostly dealing with geometric/trigonometric aspects of the celestial sphere.<BR></P>
	<CENTER>

		<P><I>Fig: Double derivative of sin(x) gives -sin(x), Source : Aryabhatiya, GaNitapadaH, verse 12</I></P>
	</CENTER>
	<P><BR>If we look at this verse in Ganitapada, "prathamAchchApajyArdhAddyarUnaM khanditaM dvitIyArdhaM, tatprathamajyAedhaMshaistaistairUnani sheSANi", which means: <BR> <I>"When the second half-(chord) partitioned is less than the first half-chord, which is (approximately equal to) the (corresponding arc) by a certain amount, the remaining (sine differences) are less (than the previous ones) each by that amount of that(i.e., the corresponding half-chord) divided by the first half-chord." </I> <BR> Or in simpler words, the second derivative of sin x with respect to x is the negative of sin x. Incredible, right?</P>
	<P>On the value of PI(Π):</P>
	<CENTER>
		<img src="images/math2.png">
		<P><I>Fig: On the value of pi, Source: Aryabhatiya, GaNitapadaH, verse 10</I></P>
	</CENTER>
	<P><I>“caturadhikaM shatamaStaguNa dvASaSTistathA sahasrANAM. Ayutadvaya viSkambhasyasanno vrittapariNAhaH.” - which on translation says that when the diameter is 20,000, the circumference is roughly 62832. Astounding!</I></P>
	<P>Another mathematician named Brahmagupta found the solution for general linear equation. He also found the resulting sum of the squares and cubes of the first n natural numbers, something some of us still definitely struggle at understanding in high-school. He further mentions four methods of multiplication in his “BrAhma-sphuTa siddhAnta”, namely (i) GomUtrika (literally translated as cow’s urine, and thus, zig-zag”, (ii) KhaNda (parts multiplication method), (iii)Bheda (mathod of differences), and (iv) ISta-guNana (algebraic method).</P>
	<P>And Bhaskara (the second) or Bhaskaracharya as he was known, was another mathematical legend of those times. His works on Differential calculus includes a primitive version of what we today know as the Rolle's theorem, which roughly states that if a function acquires the value zero at 2 positions of x, say a and b, then there must be at least one point in between these 2 values of x such that the derivative of the function is zero at that point. Though his statement lacked formal proof, it is nevertheless astonishing to think he had conceived such an idea as early as in the the 1000 ADs. Furthermore, he was the first to state that a number divided by zero equals infinity and a number added to infinity equals infinity. Infinities are hard to comprehend even in present times, to think they found out about these concepts so early on!</P>
	<P>Moving on, we find that another mathematician who went by the name Varahamihira, discovered what is today known as Pascal's triangle, which has several applications in probability, statistics, combinatorics.</P>
	
	<p><h4><b><i><br><br><a id="5"></a>Astronomical Works</i></b></h4></p>
	<p>Moving on to some of the astronomical works. Once again, we turn to Aryabhatta and his Aryabhatiya. He was among the earliest scholars to claim that the earth roates about its axis. In his Golapada, we find explicit mention of his acknowledgement of the relativity of motion, in the 9th and 10th verses. The 9th verse goes as:<i>"anulomagatirnaisthaH pashyatyachalaM vilomagaM yadvat. achalAni bhAni tadvat samapashchimagAni lankAyAM."</i></p>
    <center>
		<img src="images/Astronomical_Works1.png" style="width:600px;height:225px";>
		<p><i>Fig : Aryabhatta’s idea of the relativity of motion, Source: Aryabhatiya, GolApada, verse 9</i></p>
	</center>
	<p><i>Which on translation means"Just as a man in a boat moving sees the stationary objects (on either side of the river) as though they were moving backwards, similarly, the stationary stars  areseen by people at Lanka (reference co-ordinate on the equator), as if they were moving exactly towards the west."</i></p>
	 <center>
		<img src="images/Astronomical_Works2.png" style="width:600px;height:225px";>
		<p><i>Fig : Aryabhatta’s idea of the relativity of motion, Source: Aryabhatiya, GolApada, verse 10</i></p>
	</center>
	<p>And the 10th verse thus follows:<br><i>"UdayAstamayanimittaM nityaM pravherg vayunA kshipataH. lankAsamapshchimago bhayanjaraH sagraho bhramati", meaning "</i>(It so appears as if) the entire structure of the asterisms together with the planets were moving exactly towards the west of Lanka, being constantly driven by the provector wind, to cause their rising and setting."</p>
	<p>His works implying the early foundations of heliocentric orbits is debatable, but, there's no doubt that he established the correct rationale behind the occurrences of solar and lunar eclipses. And as for gravitation, it was Varahamihira who laid down his first ideas on the same, claiming that it is that force which causes objects to stay stuck to the earth. It is beyond fascinating to think of what these early thinkers accomplished during those times when there were no modern instruments available to help them with their calculations.</p>

	<p><h4><b><i><br><br><a id="6"></a>Medicinal Contributions</i></b></h4></p>
	<p>The names of Sushruta and Charaka shouldn't sound alien to your ears if you are acquainted with the origin of medicinal science. Their books, namely the Sushruta Samahita and Charaka Samahita are gems when it comes to this. While the former contains detailed records on surgical methods, and stresses on the vitality of knowing the human body by dissecting the dead in order to perform successful surgery, the latter contains the secrets to ayurvedic medicines, which even today could revolutionarize the world from a pharmaceutical point of view. Even in Germany, Ayurveda is widely studied, and it is a pity we are replacing this age-old medicine system developed by our ancestors completely with the present chemical drugs, instead of finding a balance between the uses of the two systems.</p>
	<p>The Sushruta Samhita (“Suśruta’s Compendium”) is an ancient Sanskrit text on medicine and surgery, and one of the most important such treatises on this subject to survive from the ancient world. <br>The Compendium of Sushruta is one of the foundational texts of Ayurveda (Indian traditional medicine), alongside the Caraka-Saṃhitā, the Bheḷa-Saṃhitā, and the medical portions of the Bower Manuscript. It is one of the two foundational Hindu texts on medical profession that have survived from ancient India. This includes advanced surgery techniques including brain surgery and information regarding 11,000 illness, 700 medicinal plants and much more. It also contains details about 8 types of surgical operations namely incising, excising, scraping, puncturing, probing, extracting, secreting fluids and suturing. All this 2600 years ago is completely astonishing. It is to be noted that Sushruta Samhita dates back to 8 B.C. 100 years before the Hippocrates(Father of Modern Medicine) era.</p>

	<p><h4><b><i><br><br><a id="7"></a>Engineering Marvels</i></b></h4></p>
	<p>And now of course, works of engineering...which are astounding to think of even in the current day. If you ever have a chance, do go and visit the temples of Southern India. They will leave you feeling perplexed.</p>
	<p>The Kailasa or Kailashanatha temple is the largest of the rock-cut Hindu temples at the Ellora Caves, Maharashtra, India. A megalith carved from a rock cliff face, it is considered one of the most remarkable cave temples in the world because of its size, architecture and sculptural treatment, and “the climax of the rock-cut phase of Indian architecture”.<br>The architecture of Kailasa Temple is notable for its vertical excavation, the work started at the top and moved downwards, rolling down the large boulders split from the mountain using steel rod drills. One can see the drill marks on the surrounding walls that are still visible. Isn’t this amazing?<br>The archaeologists had calculated that it would have taken more than a hundred years to finish the temple construction. But, in reality it took only 18 years to complete it. The rock cut temple was cut in U shape about 50 metres in the back, and about 2,00,000 tonnes of rock was scooped out of a vertical basalt cliff in the Charanandri Hills to form the magnificent temple.</p>

		<p><i>Fig : Iron Temple in New Delhi</i></p>
	</center>
	<p> Also, several temples were modelled based on the "Vimana" structure, and as the nomenclature of this architecture suggests, these temples resemble flying space-crafts to a great extent. Moving on from temples, there was also an Institute for Structural mechanics in Aihole, Karnataka during the 6th century AD. And as if that weren't enough, even in the present day, we have the Iron Pillar in Delhi, a standing testimony of the engineering marvels of ancient India. An iron pillar that hasn't rusted an inch till date... The inscriptions include those during Chandragupta II's times, and the Samvat 1109 inscription... Even when it came to metallurgy, especially of zinc, Bharat had secrets unbeknown to the dwellers in the world outside. The practice of metal extraction started in Bharat as far back as the 3rd millennium B.C.E., and mentions of metallurgical sciences has been found in texts such as the Rig Veda, Arthashastra etc.</p>

	<p><h3><b><u><br><br><a id="8"></a>Modern times and influence on the West</u></b></h3></p>
	<p>Coming to present times, one can conclude that Sanskrit has influenced cultures all over the world. Not only has it influenced other languages, such as Sino-Tibetan languages which has its roots in Sanskrit, and several other seemingly distant languages. Even Russian has several distinct similarities with Sanskrit. Several countries have adopted Sanskrit as a part of the academic curriculum as well. St James Junior School in London, England, offers Sanskrit as part of the curriculum. Since September 2009, US high school students have been able to receive credits as Independent Study or toward Foreign Language requirements by studying Sanskrit as part of the <i>SAFL: Samskritam as a Foreign Language;</i> program coordinated by Samskrita Bharati. <br>And apart from this, Sanskrit has largely influenced modern science. In the words of Oscar Pujol, <i>"Sanskrit is very much alive and well. Sanskrit can still influence philosophical thought and human science in the modern world."</i> Let us look at some of the impacts this language had on the West. For instance, the Fibonacci Sequence. <br>The Fibonacci sequence is a very interesting existing sequence. In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the previous two, starting from 0 and 1. Therefore, the sequence looks like this : 
	<center>
		<img src="images/Modern-times_and_Influence_on_the_West1.png">
		<p><i>Fig : The Golden Spiral and Fibonacci Numbers</i></p>
	</center>
	<p>Fibonacci sequence has its origin in ancient India. It was embedded in Chanda Shastra. What we call as Chanda Shastra, was pioneered by a Saint-Scholar (Rishi) named Pingala in the 2nd century BC. (Although recent archaeological evidences suggest that it was 4th century BC). In fact, not only did Pingala conceptualize the series (what we call as Fibonacci series today) as part of Chanda Shastra, but even extended it to the concept of a pyramid of stacked numbers which we call as Pascal’s Triangle today. While Pingala & Varahamihira had used the number series for their respective fields like Sanskrit Prosody & Astronomy, one of the most comprehensive commentary on it applying it to various other fields, was later done by a Hindu Jain Scholar named Acharya Hemachandra in the 12th century AD. Fibonacci sequence is synonymous to our lives. It appears in asymmetric cell division, microbiological process, DNA supra-code under optimal conditions. It is not just applied in Biology but also seen in Physics and Mathematics (Differential Equation), in bifurcation and diagrams which are necessary for studying dynamic systems under time evaluation and chaos. Natural dispersion of seeds also occurs in Fibonacci pattern. This sequence is also seen in computational run-time analysis like Gabriel Lame’s theorem. And in fact, it also appears in form of the golden mean in musical compositions (even in those by Western composers, like Mozart), and is responsible for the soothing harmonies we here in tonal music. The sequence also attributes to the aesthetically pleasing logos. <br>Nicolas Tesla, an eminent physicist, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer and inventor of Serbian-American origin who discovered several principles of electromagnetism, was also closely acquainted with the Sanskrit terminology and philosophy. The ancient Vedic philosophy greatly influenced his ideas on the properties of space. In fact, one can find the use of the Sanskrit terms “AkAsha” and “prANa” in his works. </p>

		<p><i>Fig : Fig: Swami Vivekananda (Left) and Nicolas Tesla (Right)</i></p>
	</center>
	<p>We can also find exchange of letters between Tesla and Swami Vivekanda, related to the theme of correlating energy and matter. Nicolas Tesla began using the Sanskrit words after meeting with Swamiji. He studied the Eastern view of the true nature of reality, about the mechanisms that drive the material world. In course of time, it helped him to lay down the basis for the wireless transmission of electrical power, to his invenstion of what is today known as the Tesla Coil Transformer.</p>
	<p>Now, we go back to where we began, the concept of Quantum Physics... The weird quantum nature of reality, that allows a particle to occur in a superposition of states rather than a single state, akin to Schrödinger's cat being both dead and alive at the same time when enclosed in the box with a Geiger counter, a vial of poison and a hammer, and choosing to collapse to a specific state on observation or measurement, and again, when left unobserved with time evolution, changing its state on further measurement. Erwin Schrödinger, who was a Vedanta, said “Some blood transfusion from India to the West is a must to save Western science from spiritual anaemia.” Heisenberg, another pioneering figure when it comes to Quantum Mechanics, stated "After (the conversations about Indian philosophy, some of the ideas of Quantum Physics that had seemed so crazy suddenly made much more sense".</p>

	 <p><h3><b><u><br><br><a id="9"></a>Conclusion</u></b></h3></p>
	 <p>So in conclusion, Sanskrit is indeed a scientific language, and in fact much more. While we begin to understand the implications of quantum physics, there are some things that are still incomprehensible mysteries, which were addressed however, in those forgone days through the DevabhaSa. Such as, the concept of consciousness, its true meaning, its true origin. While modern science takes a direction to try and prove that consciousness arises through matter itself, it is doubtful to what extent a research on the same would prove to be successful. The essence of consciousness is much deeper than that, and it may yet take science in the form we know today several years or perhaps decades to truly connect the ties. To connect the infinitesimal with the infinite. To answer deeper questions about life and existence. To come up with a fulfilling theory that could ultimately bind the observer with the observed.</p>
	 <p>Perhaps we should pause to ponder awhile, about all these things which were discovered so many years back, and are being proved true today using scientific methodology. Perhaps we should open up our minds and look through without the lenses of so-called “scientific ego”, and accept the truth without letting our imperfect senses judge the quantum nature of reality, the veracity of the spiritual realm of dimensions incomprehensible to our restricted human capacities.</p>

	 <p><h3><b><u><br><br><a id="10"></a>Why we chose this project</u></b></h3></p>
	 <p>The reason we decided to take up this topic as our project is in hopes to spread the true rationale behind this language and inspire the rising generation to learn it. As Nasa today acknowledges the scientific nature/grammar of Sanskrit, it is discouraging to see the youth of the present disregarding the ties we have to this rich heritage. We aren't trying to glorify our past, rather trying to put forward what the language was truly capable of, and still is. <br>Moreover, as students of science and engineering at a premiere institute of the country, IIT Kharagpur, it is only natural that we explore the history of scientific works that hold their foundations on the soils of our nation. And since we feel intrigued and inspired by what we have learnt, we wish to share this knowledge and the joy of learning with you, hoping that you apply the main takeaway of this video, somehow, somewhere in your lives. Sanskrit is a language in which ancient thinkers asked questions, reshaped the questions, discovered answers and thus simultaneously even more questions, and such a language undoubtedly renders a logical and questioning mind. <br>With millions of texts still left undecoded in Sanskrit, of which a fair portion comprises of scientific texts, it is high-time that we rose together and joined hands on the task of decrypting and unveiling the mysteries of an ancient yet advanced forgotten civilization, with Sanskrit as the primary key to decipher these amazing secrets.</p>
